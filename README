This Apache Xerces-J GitHub repos branch contains following XML Schema 1.1 tests:
1) Xerces-J implementation of W3C XML Schema 1.1 test-suite within the folder "w3c_xmlschema11-testsuite".
2) Xerces-J specific XML Schema 1.1 tests within the folders "src" and "data" at the top-level of this 
codebase repos branch.

Instructions for running Xerces-J specifc XML Schema 1.1 tests:
Minimum JRE needed to run these tests is 1.8. These unit tests contain a folder "data" parallel 
to the "src" folder, that contain the XML and XML Schema documents needed to run the unit tests. Before 
running this unit test-suite the following JVM argument needs to be provided,
-Dorg.apache.xerces.tests.dataDir=<path to data directory>
(these unit tests, retrieve XML and XML Schema documents relative to this folder location)

The class "AllXercesXSD11Tests" is an entry point to run this unit test-suite.
