This SVN branch contains, following XML Schema 1.1 tests,
1) IBM / Xerces implementation of W3C XML Schema 1.1 test suite (within the folder "w3c_xmlschema11-testsuite").
2) Xerces proprietary XML Schema 1.1 tests (within the top level folders, "src" and "data").

Configuration notes, for running Xerces proprietary XML Schema 1.1 tests:
Minimum JRE needed to run these tests is 1.7. These unit tests contain a folder "data" parallel 
to the "src" folder, that contain the XML and XSD documents needed for the unit tests. Before 
invoking this unit test suite, the following argument needs to be provided to the Java VM,
-Dorg.apache.xerces.tests.dataDir=<path to data directory>
(the unit tests, retrieve XML and XSD documents relative to this directory location)

The class "AllXercesXSD11Tests" is the entry point of this unit test suite.

Acknowledgements:
Many of the Xerces proprietary, XML Schema 1.1 tests within this SVN branch, were contributed by 
Roger L. Costello (costello@mitre.org), and have been included here with Roger's permission. 
Roger's contributions of useful XML Schema 1.1 examples to this test suite is highly appreciated. 
Roger has been an active contributor to the XML Schema standards work.
