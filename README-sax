SAX 2.0.2 (sax2r3)
2004-04-27

This is another bugfix release for SAX2.  It makes minimal changes
(mostly in features and properties) to make SAX2 compliant with the
new XML 1.1 and Namespaces 1.1 recommendations, including Unicode
normalization.  The changes are minor and should not affect most
applications.

One significant point is that this release flags a conflict (which
already existed) between the JavaDoc for fatalError() and the JavaDoc
for endDocument().  It is not currently clear whether a SAX
implementation must invoke the endDocument() callback after reporting
a fatal error, and the documentation simply mentions this fact and
advises application writers not to rely on either behaviour until the
ambiguity is resolved in the next major release.

See CHANGES and ChangeLog for more details.

SAX 2.0.1 (sax2r2)
29-January-2002

This is a bugfix release for SAX2, the second generation of the Simple
API for XML.  Changes from the SAX 2.0 release can be summarized as:

    - Numerous documentation improvements and clarifications.
    - Bundling the optional "SAX2 Extensions 1.0" support.
    - Bugfixes:
	* Bugfixed classes include ParserAdapter, AttributesImpl
	* Factory classes use the correct class loader (JDK 1.2 and later)
	* Some exceptions were missing default constructors
	* DefaultHandler was missing an exception spec
	* Resetting handlers to their default values is legal
    - Slightly less memory use in NamespaceSupport, AttributesImpl.
    - Better configurability for the default XMLReader.
    - NamespaceSupport enforces its declare-before-use constraint

Other than bugfixes, the APIs have not been changed.  This is intended to
be a drop-in replacement for the previous SAX2 release.  API-conformant
code will not notice any differences.

If you are using JDK 1.4, you should be able to copy "sax.jar" into
the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed directory to have it replace the older
version of SAX2 that is distributed with that JVM.  If you're using
JRE 1.4, that path won't include the "jre".

As a SourceForge project, SAX now has public CVS access, a database
for bugs and RFEs, mailing lists, and a web site.
