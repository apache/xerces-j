<s1 title="Reporting Bugs in Jira">
<s2 title="Before you report a bug">
<p> Before you report a bug, please, <em>read</em> the following instructions:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>If doubt exists whether the behavior in question is a bug 
          or a feature, please post a message to the <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/mail.html#xerces-j-user">
          j-users@xerces.apache.org</jump> list for clarification.
         </li>
	<li>To help to eliminate duplicate or invalid bug reports, such as the
	    <jump href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-581">external-schemaLocation</jump> bug, 
	    <em>please take a quick look at bugs in JIRA</em> opened against the version you're working 
        with to see whether the bug has been already reported and/or fixed.
	    You can also download or clone the 
	    <jump href='https://github.com/apache/xerces-j/tree/main'>latest code</jump> 
	    from github and check if you can reproduce the bug.</li>
	  <li>Report bugs against the newest release.</li>
	  <li>Sign up for an account on the <jump href="https://issues.apache.org/jira">Apache JIRA instance</jump>.
          Go to the <jump href='https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html'>self-serve signup page</jump>
          to apply for an account, which needs the project's approval.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We strongly encourage you to write patches for problems you find and submit 
         them to <jump href="https://xml.apache.org/mail.html#xerces-j-dev">j-dev@xerces.apache.org</jump>.
         Being specific in the description of your bug report, and providing enough information to reproduce the 
         bug will improve the likelihood that the bug you found will be fixed in the foreseeable future. In the 
         interest of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design issues, we need your 
         active participation in the ongoing development of Xerces2.</p>
