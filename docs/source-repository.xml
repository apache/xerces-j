  <s2 title="Overview">
    <p>The &ParserNameLong; source code is stored in the Subversion
       repository (SVN). The SVN repository is public and everyone
       has read access. The repository uses a standard layout of:</p>

<source>
<jump href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/</jump>
                                        |
                                        | - <jump href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/branches/">branches/</jump>
                                        |
                                        | - <jump href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/tags/">tags/</jump>
                                        \
                                          - <jump href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/trunk/">trunk/</jump>
</source>

    <p>For example, to check out the trunk (the place where the main
       development is taking place), execute:</p>

<source>
svn co <jump href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/trunk">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/trunk</jump>
</source>

    <p>To check out the code in the stax-dev branch, execute:</p>

<source>
svn co <jump href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/branches/stax-dev">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/branches/stax-dev</jump>
</source>

    <p>To check out the code tagged Xerces-J_2_6_2, execute:</p>

<source>
svn co <jump href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/tags/Xerces-J_2_6_2">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/java/tags/Xerces-J_2_6_2</jump>
</source>

    <p>You may also browse above cited Xerces2 repository and examine individual
       files using the <jump href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xerces/java/trunk/">Web
       interface</jump>.</p>
    <p>
       Xerces2 also includes an XML Schema 1.1 processor. For some of its implementation, an XML Schema 1.1 
       processor requires an XPath 2.0 engine. Apache Xerces in collaboration with <jump href="https://www.eclipse.org/webtools">Eclipse Foundation's Web 
       Tools Platform (WTP) project</jump>, has contributed to the development of an XPath 2.0 engine that is 
       used within XercesJ's XML Schema 1.1 processor. The XercesJ specific source code of this 
       XPath 2.0 engine, is located on following GitHub repository : <jump href="https://github.com/xercesj/xpath20">https://github.com/xercesj/xpath20</jump>.
