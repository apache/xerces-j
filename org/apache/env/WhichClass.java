 *
 * <p>This class detects JDKs 1.1.x versus 1.2+ and may attempt to 
 * either use the current classLoader or may use a contextClassLoader.  
 * Note that in some servlet environments or in IDE environments 
 * like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> that the 
 * difference between classloaders is very important!  Changes in 
 * the JAXP FactoryFinder classes should be actively evaluated for 
 * inclusion/copying here.</p>
