    <p>This package is a somewhat simplistic environment checking
    utility.  It allows users in various environments to self-test 
    their specific deployed environment to ensure that they have the 
    correct classes present.  Which is currently focused on various 
    XML issues but is architected to be generic and easily extensible.</p>
    <p>Most of the documentation is included in the Javadocs for the 
    various classes.  Which is a framework into which various 'checkers' 
    or WhichProject implementations can be plugged; it then asks each 
    implementation to fill in whatever information it can into a common 
    Hashtable, which it then reports back to the user in one of a number 
    of formats.</p>
    <p>Most useful for reporting environments in automated builds or 
    for a self-help system version detection for users reporting bugs.</p>
