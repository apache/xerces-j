Schema  DOM and XSL technologies are available in beta versions of
popular web browsers and application development software  The
widespread availability of these technologies has made them obvious
choices as building blocks for electronic commerce  As such  conformance
of these products to the W3C Recommendations is necessary to build
interoperable solutions  The Organization for the Advancement of
Structured Information Standards  OASIS  consortium was formed to
accelerate the adoption of these standards by addressing market needs
and directions  and recommending guidelines for product interoperability
and conformance 

NIST/ITL is collaborating with industry to solve
these problems using the following related tasks:

Provide technical leadership by chairing and/or participating in
      appropriate OASIS and W3C efforts  including OASIS XML and
      XSLT/Xpath Conformance Subcommittees  W3C XSL-FO  DOM  and XML
      Schema Working Groups
