 NIST/ITL is working with the Organization for the
Advancement of Structured Information Standards  OASIS   the prominent
industry consortium for defining specifications for the discovery and
retrieval of XML-related documents  NIST chairs the OASIS
Registry/Repository Technical Committee and is a significant
contributor  NIST/ITL is also working within the ebXML Project  a joint
project between OASIS and the United Nations body for Trade Facilitation
and Electronic Business  UN/CEFACT   the prominent business-oriented 
international standards organization for the discovery  retrieval  and
use of business processes and related documents  The role of NIST/ITL is
to influence the quality  correctness  and testability of the
specifications of both the OASIS and ebXML Registry/Repository Working
Groups through our reference implementation of a registry and repository
that is conformant to both specifications  Additionally  NIST/ITL
facilitates cross-over discussions between OASIS and ebXML; thus helping
to ensure compatibility of the specifications 

 NIST/ITL  through its leadership in developing a reference
implementation that is compliant to both specifications  will help
ensure that both specifications are unambiguous  complete  and testable 
This work will also contribute to the compatibility of these two
specifications  An early indication of success is that the draft ebXML
specification uses the OASIS specification as its basis  The completion
of these specifications will allow small- and medium-sized enterprises
 SMEs  to make appropriate choices with regard to EC tools and
applications  and will allow them access to the emerging supply chain
and industry partnership EC models
