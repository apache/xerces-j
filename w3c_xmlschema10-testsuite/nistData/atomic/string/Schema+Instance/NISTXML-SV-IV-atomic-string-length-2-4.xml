Work with industry to ensure that these tests are used as
      metrology tools  and that the results of the tests are fed back
      into both the standards process and the development process 

As chair of the OASIS XML Conformance Subcommittee  NIST/ITL
led the development of the widely used XML test suite  NIST/ITL has
further developed in cooperation with OASIS and W3C  robust testing
resources for related XML technologies  including XML Schemas  DOM  and
XSL  Developers and users utilize these tools to exercise both the
appropriate W3C Recommendation and the associated implementations 
Errors and ambiguities raised as a result of these tools are fed back
into the development process for correction in future revisions
