Test Case Type: Instance invalid test
Description   : When an xsi:type attribute appears on an element, and has a QName as its value,
 but the QName does not resolve to a known type definition, processors are now 
 required to "fall back" to lax validation, using the declared {type definition}  
 of the governing element declaration as the governing type definition.
