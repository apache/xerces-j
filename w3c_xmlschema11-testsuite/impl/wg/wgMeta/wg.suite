   This isn't really a full test suite, so it's not clear that using a
   testSuite element is correct.

   This dummy document is provided in case anyone's existing test harness
   requires it or benefits from having it.  For fuller information on this 
   suite of tests, see the individualv test set document(s) listed below.
