<h2 id='ID-E7C3082-h2' class='div2'>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface 
      (<a href='glossary.html#dt-API'>API</a>) for valid <a href='glossary.html#dt-HTML'>HTML</a> and
      well-formed <a href='glossary.html#dt-XML'>XML</a> documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and
      the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification,
      the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a
      way of representing many different kinds of information that may
      be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally
      be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents
      this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.<p>With the Document
      Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate
      their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.
      Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed,
      changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model,
      with a few exceptions - in particular, the DOM <a href='glossary.html#dt-interface'>interfaces</a> for
      the XML internal and external subsets have not yet been specified.<p>As a W3C specification, one important objective for the Document
      Object Model is to provide a standard programming interface that
      can be used in a wide variety of environments and <a href='glossary.html#dt-application'>applications</a>.
      The DOM is designed to be used with any programming
      language. In order to provide a precise, language-independent
      specification of the DOM interfaces, we have chosen to define
      the specifications in Object Management Group (OMG) IDL [<cite><a class='noxref normative' href='references.html#OMGIDL'>OMG IDL</a></cite>], as defined in the CORBA 2.3.1 specification [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#CORBA'>CORBA</a></cite>]. In addition to the OMG IDL specification, we provide
      <a href='glossary.html#dt-lang-binding'>language bindings</a> for Java [<cite><a class='noxref normative' href='references.html#Java'>Java</a></cite>] and ECMAScript [<cite><a class='noxref normative' href='references.html#ECMAScript'>ECMAScript</a></cite>] (an industry-standard scripting
      language based on JavaScript [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#JavaScript'>JavaScript</a></cite>] and JScript
      [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#JScript'>JScript</a></cite>]). Because of language
      binding restrictions, a mapping has to be applied between the OMG
      IDL and the programming language in used. For example, while the
      DOM uses IDL attributes in the definition of interfaces, Java does
    not allow interfaces to contain attributes:</p>
<div class='code-block'>
<pre>// example 1: removing the first child of an element using ECMAScript
mySecondTrElement.removeChild(mySecondTrElement.firstChild);

// example 2: removing the first child of an element using Java
mySecondTrElement.removeChild(mySecondTrElement.getFirstChild());</pre>
</div><p><b>Note:</b> OMG IDL is used only as a language-independent and
	implementation-neutral way to specify <a href='glossary.html#dt-interface'>interfaces</a>. Various other
	IDLs could have been used ([<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#COM'>COM</a></cite>], [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#JavaIDL'>Java IDL</a></cite>], [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#MSIDL'>MIDL</a></cite>], ...). In general, IDLs 
	are designed for specific computing environments. The Document Object
	Model can be implemented in any computing environment, and does not 
	require the object binding runtimes generally associated with 
	such IDLs.
      </p>
</div> <!-- div2 ID-E7C3082 -->
<div class='div2'><a name='ID-E7C30821'></a>
<h2 id='ID-E7C30821-h2' class='div2'>What the Document Object Model is</h2>
<p>The DOM is a programming <a href='glossary.html#dt-API'>API</a> for documents.
      It is based on an object structure that closely resembles the structure of the
      documents it <a href='glossary.html#dt-model'>models</a>. For instance, consider this table, taken
      from an XHTML document: </p>
<div class='code-block'>
<pre>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt; 
    &lt;tr&gt; 
      &lt;td&gt;Shady Grove&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Aeolian&lt;/td&gt; 
    &lt;/tr&gt; 
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Over the River, Charlie&lt;/td&gt;        
      &lt;td&gt;Dorian&lt;/td&gt; 
    &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
</div><p>
      A graphical representation of the DOM of the example table, with
      whitespaces in element content (often abusively called "ignorable
      whitespace") removed, is:      
    <div class='figure' style='text-align: center'>
<img src='./images/table.png' alt='graphical representation of the DOM of the example table' title='graphical representation of the DOM of the example table'>
<p style='text-align:left'><i>Figure: graphical representation of the DOM of the example table
</i> [<a href='./images/table'>SVG 1.0 version</a>]
</p>
</div>

<p>
      An example of DOM manipulation using ECMAScript would be:
    </p>
<div class='code-block'>
<pre>// access the tbody element from the table element
var myTbodyElement = myTableElement.firstChild;

// access its second tr element
// The list of children starts at 0 (and not 1).
var mySecondTrElement = myTbodyElement.childNodes[1];

// remove its first td element
mySecondTrElement.removeChild(mySecondTrElement.firstChild);

// change the text content of the remaining td element
mySecondTrElement.firstChild.firstChild.data = "Peter";</pre>
</div><p>In the DOM, documents have a logical
      structure which is very much like a tree; to be more precise, which is
      like a "forest" or "grove",
      which can contain more than one tree. Each document contains zero or one
      doctype nodes, one document element node,
      and zero or more comments 
		or processing instructions; the document element serves as the root
		of the element tree for the document. However, the DOM
      does not specify that documents must be <em>implemented</em> as a
      tree or a grove, nor
      does it specify how the relationships among objects be
      implemented. The DOM is a logical model that may be implemented in any
      convenient manner. In this
      specification, we use the term <em>structure model</em> to
      describe the tree-like representation of a document.
      We also use the term "tree" when referring to the arrangement of 
      those information items which can be reached by using "tree-walking" 
      methods; (this does not include attributes).
      One important property of DOM structure models
      is <em>structural isomorphism</em>: if any two Document
      Object Model implementations are used to create a representation
      of the same document, they will create the same structure model,
      in accordance with the XML Information Set [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#InfoSet'>XML Information Set</a></cite>].<p><b>Note:</b> There may be some variations depending on the parser being
	used to build the DOM. For instance, the DOM may not contain
	white spaces in element content if the parser discards them.</p>
<p>The name "Document Object Model" was chosen because
      it is an "<a href='glossary.html#dt-object-model'>object model</a>" in the traditional
      object oriented design sense: documents are modeled using
      objects, and the model encompasses not only the structure of a
      document, but also the behavior of a document and the objects
      of which it is composed. In other words, the nodes in the
      above diagram do not represent a data structure, they
      represent objects, which have functions and identity. As an
      object model, the DOM identifies:<ul>
<li>
the interfaces and objects used to represent and manipulate
	  a document</li>
<li>
the semantics of these interfaces and objects - including
	  both behavior and attributes</li>
<li>
the relationships and collaborations among these interfaces
	  and objects</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure of SGML documents has traditionally been
      represented by an abstract <a href='glossary.html#dt-datamodel'>data model</a>, not by an object model.
      In an abstract <a href='glossary.html#dt-datamodel'>data model</a>, the model is centered around the
      data. In object oriented programming languages, the data itself
      is encapsulated in objects that hide the data, protecting it
      from direct external manipulation. The functions associated with
      these objects determine how the objects may be manipulated, and
      they are part of the object model.</div> <!-- div2 ID-E7C30821 -->
<div class='div2'><a name='ID-E7C30822'></a>
<h2 id='ID-E7C30822-h2' class='div2'>What the Document Object Model is not</h2>
<p>This section is designed to give a more precise understanding
      of the DOM by distinguishing it from other
      systems that may seem to be like it.<ul>
<li>
The Document Object Model is not a binary specification.
	  DOM programs written in the same language binding will be
	  source code compatible across platforms, but the DOM
	  does not define any form of binary interoperability.</li>
<li>
The Document Object Model is not a way of persisting objects
	  to XML or HTML. Instead of specifying how objects may be
	  represented in XML, the DOM specifies how
	  XML and HTML documents are represented as objects, so that
	  they may be used in object oriented programs.</li>
<li>
The Document Object Model is not a set of data structures;
	  it is an <a href='glossary.html#dt-object-model'>object model</a> that specifies interfaces. Although this
	  document contains diagrams showing parent/child relationships,
	  these are logical relationships defined by the programming
	  interfaces, not representations of any particular internal
	  data structures.</li>
<li>
The Document Object Model does not define what information in a
	  document is relevant or how information in a document is structured. For
	  XML, this is specified by the XML Information Set [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#InfoSet'>XML Information Set</a></cite>]. The DOM is simply an <a href='glossary.html#dt-API'>API</a> to this information set. </li>
<li>
The Document Object Model, despite its name, is not a
	  competitor to the Component Object Model [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#COM'>COM</a></cite>]. COM, like
	  CORBA, is a language independent way to specify interfaces and
	  objects; the DOM is a set of interfaces and
	  objects designed for managing HTML and XML documents. The DOM
	  may be implemented using language-independent systems like COM
	  or CORBA; it may also be implemented using language-specific
	  bindings like the Java or ECMAScript bindings specified in
	  this document.</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- div2 ID-E7C30822 -->
<div class='div2'><a name='ID-E7C30823'></a>
<h2 id='ID-E7C30823-h2' class='div2'>Where the Document Object Model came from</h2>
<p>The DOM originated as a specification to
      allow JavaScript scripts and Java programs to be portable among
      Web browsers.  "Dynamic HTML" was  the immediate ancestor of the
      Document Object Model, and it was originally thought of largely
      in terms of  browsers. However, when the DOM
      Working Group was formed at W3C, it was also joined by vendors in other
      domains, including HTML or XML editors and document
      repositories. Several of these vendors had worked with SGML
      before XML was developed; as a result, the DOM
      has been influenced by SGML Groves and the HyTime standard. Some
      of these vendors had also developed their own object models for
      documents in order to provide an API for SGML/XML
      editors or document repositories, and these object models have
      also influenced the DOM.</div> <!-- div2 ID-E7C30823 -->
<div class='div2'><a name='ID-E7C30824'></a>
<h2 id='ID-E7C30824-h2' class='div2'>Entities and the DOM Core</h2>
<p>In the fundamental DOM interfaces, there are no objects representing
      entities. Numeric character references, and references to the
      pre-defined entities in HTML and XML, are replaced by the
      single character that makes up the entity's replacement.
      For example, in:   
    </p>
<div class='code-block'>
<pre>
        &lt;p&gt;This is a dog &amp;amp; a cat&lt;/p&gt;        
      </pre>
</div><p>
      the "&amp;amp;" will be replaced by the character "&amp;", and the text
      in the P element will form a single continuous sequence of
      characters. Since numeric character references and pre-defined entities
      are not recognized as such in CDATA sections, or in the SCRIPT and STYLE
      elements in HTML, they are not replaced by the single character they
      appear to refer to. If the example above were enclosed in a CDATA
      section, the "&amp;amp;" would not be replaced by "&amp;"; neither would
      the &lt;p&gt; be recognized as a start tag. The representation of general
      entities, both internal and external, are defined within the
      extended (XML) interfaces of <a href='core.html#Core'>Document Object Model Core</a>.<p>
      Note: When a DOM representation of a document is serialized
      as XML or HTML text, applications will need to check each
      character in text data to see if it needs to be escaped
      using a numeric or pre-defined entity. Failing to do so
      could result in invalid HTML or XML. Also, <a href='glossary.html#dt-implementation'>implementations</a> should be
      aware of the fact that serialization into a character encoding
      ("charset") that does not fully cover ISO 10646 may fail if there are
      characters in markup or CDATA sections that are not present in the
      encoding.</div> <!-- div2 ID-E7C30824 -->
<div class='div2'><a name='DOMArchitecture'></a>
<h2 id='DOMArchitecture-h2' class='div2'>DOM Architecture</h2>
<p>
      The DOM specifications provide a set of APIs that forms the DOM
      API. Each DOM specification defines one or more modules and each
      module is associated with one feature name. For example, the DOM
      Core specification (this specification) defines two modules:
    <ul>
<li>
The Core module, which contains the fundamental interfaces
	  that must be implemented by all DOM conformant
	  implementations, is associated with the feature name "Core";</li>
<li>

	  The XML module, which contains the interfaces that must be
	  implemented by all conformant XML 1.0 [<cite><a class='noxref informative' href='references.html#XML'>XML 1.0</a></cite>] (and higher) DOM implementations, is
	  associated with the feature name "XML".
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
      The following representation contains all DOM modules, represented
      using their feature names, defined along the DOM specifications:
    <div class='figure' style='text-align: center'>
<img src='./images/dom-architecture.png' alt='A view of the DOM Architecture' title='A view of the DOM Architecture'>
<p style='text-align:left'><i>Figure: A view of the DOM Architecture
</i> [<a href='./images/dom-architecture'>SVG 1.0 version</a>]
</p>
</div>

<p>
      A DOM implementation can then implement one (i.e. only the Core
      module) or more modules depending on the host application. A Web
      user agent is very likely to implement the "MouseEvents" module,
      while a server-side application will have no use of this module
      and will probably not implement it.
    </div> <!-- div2 DOMArchitecture -->
<div class='div2'><a name='ID-Conformance'></a>
<h2 id='ID-Conformance-h2' class='div2'>Conformance</h2>
<p>
      This section explains the different levels of conformance to DOM Level 3.
      DOM Level 3 consists of 16 modules. It is possible to conform to DOM
      Level 3, or to a DOM Level 3 module.
    <p>
      An implementation is DOM Level 3 conformant if it supports the Core
      module defined in this document (see <a href='core.html#ID-BBACDC08'>Fundamental Interfaces: Core Module</a>). An
      implementation conforms to a DOM Level 3 module if it supports all the
      interfaces for that module and the associated semantics.
    <p>
      Here is the complete list of DOM Level 3.0 modules and the features used
      by them.  Feature names are case-insensitive.

<div class='div2'><a name='ID-E7C30826'></a>
<h2 id='ID-E7C30826-h2' class='div2'>DOM Interfaces and DOM Implementations</h2>
<p>The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or
      HTML documents. It is important to realize that these interfaces
      are an abstraction - much like "abstract base classes" in C++,
      they are a means of specifying a way to access and manipulate an
      application's internal representation of a document. Interfaces 
	do not imply a particular concrete
      implementation. Each DOM application is free to maintain
      documents in any convenient representation, as long as the
      interfaces shown in this specification are supported. Some
      DOM implementations will be existing programs that use the
      DOM interfaces to access software written long before the
      DOM specification existed. Therefore, the DOM is designed
      to avoid implementation dependencies; in particular,<ol>
<li>
Attributes defined in the IDL do not imply concrete
	  objects which must have specific data members - in the
	  language bindings, they are translated to a pair of
	  get()/set() functions, not to a data member. Read-only
	  attributes have only a get() function in the language
	  bindings.  </li>
<li>
DOM applications may provide additional interfaces
	  and objects not found in this specification and still be
	  considered DOM conformant.</li>
<li>
Because we specify interfaces and not the actual
	  objects that are to be created, the DOM cannot know what
	  constructors to call for an implementation.  In general,
	  DOM users call the createX() methods on the Document
	  class to create document structures, and DOM
	  implementations create their own internal representations
	  of these structures in their implementations of the
	  createX() functions.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
      The Level 2 interfaces were extended to provide both Level 2 and Level 3
      functionality.
    <p>
      DOM implementations in languages other than Java or ECMAScript may choose
      bindings that are appropriate and natural for their language and run time
      environment.  For example, some systems may need to create a Document3
