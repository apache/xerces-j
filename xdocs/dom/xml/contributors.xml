  <div2 id="Productions"><head>Production Systems</head> 
	 <p>This specification was written in XML. The HTML, OMG IDL, Java and ECMA
		Script bindings were all produced automatically.</p> 
	 <p>Thanks to Joe English, author of 
		<loc href="http://www.flightlab.com/cost">cost</loc>, which was used as
		the basis for producing DOM Level 1. Thanks also to Gavin Nicol, who wrote the
		scripts which run on top of cost. Arnaud Le Hors and Philippe Le H&eacute;garet
		maintained the scripts.</p> 
	 <p>For DOM Level 2, we used 
		<loc href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j">Xerces</loc> as the basis DOM
		implementation and wish to thank the authors. Philippe Le H&eacute;garet and Arnaud
		Le Hors wrote the 
		<loc
		 href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/tools/specgenerator/">Java
		  programs</loc> which are the DOM application.</p> 
	 <p>Thanks also to Jan K&#228;rrman, author of 
		<loc href="http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html">html2ps</loc>, which
