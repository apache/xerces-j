    This document is published under the <specref
    ref="Copyright-notice-document"/>. The bindings within this document are
    published under the <specref ref="Copyright-notice-software"/>.  The
    software license requires "Notice of any changes or modifications to the
    W3C files, including the date changes were made." Consequently, modified
    versions of the DOM bindings must document that they do not conform to the
    W3C standard; in the case of the IDL definitions, the pragma prefix can no
    longer be 'w3c.org'; in the case of the Java Language binding, the package
    names can no longer be in the 'org.w3c' package.
