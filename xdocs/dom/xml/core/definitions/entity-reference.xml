  <descr><p><code>EntityReference</code> objects may be inserted into the
      structure model when an entity reference is in the source document, or
      when the user wishes to insert an entity reference. Note that character
      references and references to predefined entities are considered to be
      expanded by the HTML or XML processor so that characters are represented
      by their Unicode equivalent rather than by an entity reference. Moreover,
      the XML processor may completely expand references to entities while
      building the structure model, instead of providing
      <code>EntityReference</code> objects. If it does provide such objects,
      then for a given <code>EntityReference</code> node, it may be that there
      is no <code>Entity</code> node representing the referenced entity. If
      such an <code>Entity</code> exists, then the subtree of the
      <code>EntityReference</code> node is in general a copy of the
      <code>Entity</code> node subtree. However, this may not be true when an
      entity contains an unbound <termref def='dt-namespaceprefix'>namespace
      prefix</termref>. In such a case, because the namespace prefix resolution
      depends on where the entity reference is, the <termref def="dt-descendant">descendants</termref> of the
      <code>EntityReference</code> node may be bound to different
      <termref def='dt-namespaceURI'>namespace URIs</termref>.</p>
    <p>As for <code>Entity</code> nodes, <code>EntityReference</code> nodes and
      all their <termref def="dt-descendant">descendants</termref> are
      <termref def="dt-readonly-node">readonly</termref>.</p>
